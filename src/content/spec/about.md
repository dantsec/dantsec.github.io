# About

Hello, there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **Software Developer**, **Hacking Enthusiast** and a **CS graduate** passionate about technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning.

With experience in building applications, exploring system internals, and understanding how things work under the hood, I enjoy diving into both **development** and **security**.

You can contact me by email ([dantsec@proton.me](mailto:dantsec@proton.me)).

*Jesus said: I am the resurrection. Anyone who believes in me, even though that person dies, will live, and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this? (Jo 11,25-26)*
